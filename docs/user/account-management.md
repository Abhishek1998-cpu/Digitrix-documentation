## Your Organization

### Understanding Your Organization

- Every user has one organization
- You are the owner of your organization
- All your posts, accounts, and data belong to your organization
- Your organization ID is unique

### Organization Name

- Set automatically when you sign up
- Usually: "YourFirstName's Org" (where YourFirstName is your first name)
- This is your workspace name

## Account Security

- Required for password resets

**How to Verify:**

- Click the verification link
- Your account is activated

### Resending Verification Email

If you didn't receive the verification email:
- Wait a few minutes
- Check your spam folder
- Use the "Resend Verification Email" feature
- There's a cooldown period (about 60 seconds) between resends

### Password Security

**Best Practices:**
- Use a strong, unique password
- Don't share your password
- Change it regularly
- Use different passwords for different services

## Account Status

### Understanding Tiers

Tiers determine what features and limits you have:

## Data Privacy

### Your Data
